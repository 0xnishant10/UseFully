            “Usefully” is an online marketplace for university students where
            they can sell their old goods and possessions to other university
            students that they are no more in need of. For those students who do
            not want to sell but rarely use their possession, we are introducing
            a renting feature where they could rent their belongings to the
            students in their own university. For example, during an exam, if
            someone needs a calculator, they can look up on usefully if someone
            has listed a calculator for renting out and if there’s a calculator
            listed for renting, that person can rent that calculator out. Our
            aim is to create a user friendly platform that could open the doors
            of opportunities and side income for students.

            Our project aims to solve the problem of irresponsible shopping and
            idleness, and on the other side creating opportunities for
            university students to help their pocket by doing the right thing.
            We are creating a sense of ownership and helping the needy at the
            right time by connecting them with the right person at the right
            time. We want to help every student and give them an opportunity to
            use their possessions correctly. We believe in converting Students
            liabilities into assets without any hassle and easy process. We want
            students to start using their possessions in the right way and
            should know how to make money out of thin air.
